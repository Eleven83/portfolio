        Q: What is the World Wide Web?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: It's a collection of HTML documents
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: What is HTML?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It's the <b>MAIN</b> doctype on the web.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Major Pieces are:
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>You and your computer and browser</li>
          <li>The Internet</li>
          <li>Servers</li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        Your browser makes requests, via the internet, to servers and the servers then respond with files that your browser is able to display.

        <ul>
          <li>Text Content (What you see)</li>
          <li>Markup (What it looks like)</li>

        Made up of things called "tags".

<!-- Trying to put an example (like the one from the notes of an element) is not easy because it keeps getting interpreted by this. -->
<!-- I found a forum that suggested using "&lt" and "&gt"-->
        Example: &lt;name&gt;Content&lt;/name&gt;

        <br>
        <pre>         Opening Tag Closing Tag</pre>
      <p>
        b tag is for <b>bold</b>

      </p>
      How are Documents Structured?:
      <ul>
        <li>Elements have a parent-child relationship. 
        <li>The Document Object Model (also known as DOM) sets the HTML elements in a “tree-like” structure where one element can contain other elements. This allows a programmer to navigate to any element in the document more easily.
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML has a "Tree-Like" Structure</li>
        <li>Boxes to HTML using div tags</li>
        <li>It's important to use a text editor like Sublime to write html</li>

        The Importance of Avoiding Repetition:
        <ul>
          <li>Can programmers save time? A: Yes.</li> 
          <li>Can programmers avoid copy and paste errors and other syntactic mistakes? A: Yes.</li>
          <li>Can programmers develop their code more efficiently? A: Yes.</li>
          <li>Can programmers maintain their code more effectively? A: Yes.</li>
          <li>Avoid Repitition</li>
          <li>Save Time</li>
          <li>Write Less Code</li>
          <li>Help Other to Read the Code</li>
          <li>Reduce Errors</li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        <b>CSS</b> = Casscading Style Sheets. A key feature of CSS is what's known as "inheritance". This means it relies on an ancestor-descendent relationship. Each nested element receives its' parent color, font, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
        You can have several CSS files (or sheets) that will be referenced in HTML and all of them will be used to find out the final and visible style for your page. Think of it in terms of laws. With CSS, the most specific rule is applied to every element That's where the word cascading comes from in CSS.This requires Abstract Thinking and the ability to find similarities. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>What is CSS?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        CSS is code written to control the STYLE of html elements. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>How does CSS control html?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        If, for example, you want to make all the &lt;h1&gt; have a black background with white text, you would write: 'h1 {
        background-color: black; color: white;<br>
        }'
      </p>
      <br>
        h1 is called a "selector" and it tells the browser to apply the following rules to every h1 element. Everything between the curly braces is a rule.
      <p>
        In CSS you first write a selector. This defines what elements of a page this style will apply to. You can select an html tag and that rule will apply to the same tags on the page. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>There are 3 ways to include CSS Styling:</b>
      </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Write CSS in the &lt;head&gt; of hte html. This is only good for small projects.</li>
          <li>Link your html to a separate CSS file</li>
            <li>
              <ul>
                <li>Helps stay organized on larger projects</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
            To do this you would write all the structural html in one file and call it main.html or similar. In a separate file, put all the CSS code and call that main.css or similar. In the head element of the html document you add a link to your main.css. EX: &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css"&gt;
          </li>
          <li>Write the style inline with html</li>
            <li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  This is generally a bad idea because there is lots of repeated code
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              With this method, you modify the style attributes of every individul element.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <b>Coding Style</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Why is <em>style</em> important?
        <ol>
          <li>Write code more efficiently</li>
          <li>Understand code better</li>
          <li>Communicate with others in a common language</li>
        </ol>
        This all leads to INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY!
      <p>
        Things to remember:
        <ul>
          <li>Double quotes are recommended over single quotes</li>
          <li>use lowercase as much as possible</li>
          <li>try to maintain 1 attribute and 1 value per line</li>
          <li>stay consistent with your style</li>
          <li>Indent appropriately</li>

        <b>4 Main Points of Box Sizing</b>
        <ol>
          <li>HTML elements are boxes and each box has 4 components.</li>
          <li>Because there are so many components to each box it can be hard to get the size of the box just right.</li>
          <li>There are 2 techniques you can use to help deal with sizing issues:</li>
            <li>
              <ol>
                <li>Set the size in % rather than px</li>
                <li>Set the box-sizing attribute to border-box for every element</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          <li>Different browsers work slightly differently. Sometimes this causes different browsers to display the same code differently</li>
        </ol>
      <p>
        <b>Box Positioning</b>
        <ol>
          <li>DIVs are block elements so, by default, they take up the entire width of a page.</li>
          <li>Adding the rule <code>display: flex;</code> to the appropreaite CSS will override this behavior and let DIVs appear next to eachother.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

        <b>Code, Test, Refine</b>
        <ol>
          <li>Look for natural boxes</li>
          <li>Look for repeated styles and semantic elements</li>
          <li>Write your html</li>
          <li>Apply Style (from BIGGEST to smallest)</li>
